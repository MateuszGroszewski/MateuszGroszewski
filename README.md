I'm an computer science student that is trying to make his way to be a developer. That's the beginning of my journey. For now my goals are to learn strong basis of Python and later on get into machine learing process, I'm also intrested in C++. All coding projects are made 100% by me from planning and designing all the way to done product. I want to automate things to make life easier and more enjoyable.
